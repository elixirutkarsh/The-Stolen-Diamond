# The-Stolen-Diamond
A valuable diamond has been stolen from a museum. The detective on the case has narrowed down the list of suspects to five individuals: Alex, Beth, Chris, Dana, and Eric. The detective has gathered the following clues:

The thief is either Beth or Chris.
If Alex is innocent, then Eric is guilty.
If Beth is innocent, then Chris is innocent as well.
If Dana is guilty, then Beth is guilty too.
If Eric is innocent, then Alex is guilty.
Can you determine who the thief is?

Solution:
By analyzing the clues, we can deduce the following:

If Alex is innocent, then Eric is guilty (Clue 2).
If Eric is innocent, then Alex is guilty (Clue 5).
Since these statements contradict each other, we can conclude that one of them must be guilty and the other innocent. Therefore, the possibilities are:

Alex is guilty and Eric is innocent.
Alex is innocent and Eric is guilty.
Now let's analyze the remaining clues:

If Beth is innocent, then Chris is innocent (Clue 3).
If Dana is guilty, then Beth is guilty (Clue 4).
Considering the possibilities from the previous deductions, we can conclude the following:

If Alex is guilty, then Eric is innocent. If Dana is guilty, then Beth is guilty (from Clue 4). This means Chris is innocent. Therefore, the thief is Beth.
If Eric is guilty, then Alex is innocent. If Dana is guilty, then Beth is guilty (from Clue 4). This means Chris is innocent. Therefore, the thief is Beth.
Hence, we can determine that the thief is Beth.
